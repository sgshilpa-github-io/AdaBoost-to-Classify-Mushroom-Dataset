Decision stump also known as level 1 decision tree is a very weak classifier. The results obtained from decision stump can be significantly improved by using some booster.
Adaboost is one of the recommended booster for boosting weak classifiers.
In order to classify a mushroom dataset which contains different atttributes of mushrooms and their corrospoding labels of being edible or non edible, I have developed a decision stump and to improve the accuracy of the classifier, have used adaboost as a booster.
